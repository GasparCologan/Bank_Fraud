    "Hacemos undersampling con 0.16 como estrategia de remuestreo. De esta forma, optimizamos el F2-Score, que es la métrica en la que estamos fijando nuestra atención. Como hemos comprobado a la hora de elaborar el modelo, cuanto mayor sea el sampling strategy a partir de 0.16, a pesar de que la F2-Score decrece, la captación de verdaderos positivos aumenta. Pero como la investigación de cada caso también tiene un coste y, utilizando la métrica F2Score ya estamos priorizando el recall sobre la precisión, decidimos quedarnos aquí. De otra forma, la cantidad de falsos positivos sería muy grande en comparación con los verdaderos positivos que recogeríamos."
